# Run benchmarks

The benchmarks are organized in three directories:

* `synthetic/`
* `iscas85/`
* `wmi/`

To run a set of enumeration experiments, `cd` into the corresponding directory and run
`./run-enum.sh` and `./plot.sh` to generate the plots.

Optionally, you can run `./run-sat.sh` to run also the satisfiability experiments.
